Alfred: Hi, can you explain to me how compression works in MongoDB? Bruce: Sure! MongoDB supports compression of data at rest. It uses either zlib or snappy compression algorithms at the collection level. When data is writen, MongoDB compresses and store it compressed. When data is read, MongoDB uncompresses it before returning it. Compression reduces storage space requirements. Alfred: Interesting, that's helpful to know. Can you also tell me how indexes are stored in MongoDB? Bruce: MongoDB indexes are stored in B-tress. The internal nodes of the B-tree contains.
